How to ssh between a cluster of Vagrant guest VMs?

I've just fixed this up in a complex multi CentOS (BoxCutter 6.9) VM Vagrant setup. There are two levels to this problem, my problem was 2:

Get your Vagrant config right so that you have a "private_network" and the IP addresses of all your VM's are in the same subnet (static or DHCP): https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/private_network.html

When ssh'ing between VM's if you get this error: 
[root@vm01 ~]# ssh root@vm02
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
The error message means that none of the authentication methods managed to authenticate your session, and there is no mention of a password option so password authentication has probably been disabled. To fix edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and check that you have PasswordAuthentication yes and it's not commented out (#), then restart sshd if required: service sshd restart (it won't disconnect any sesssions coz it's clever).
